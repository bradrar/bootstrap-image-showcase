**The site uses bootstrap and makes use of the grid system for the photos.**

### Responsive Design

The website is responsive. If you are using a desktop and minimize the window, you can see that the grid 
scales down to 2 photos for medium to small size devices and 1 photo for extra small size device

I made the navigation bar fixed at the top so when you scroll down, the navbar is still at the top.

customized color for the navbar header and the jumbotron to make it look professional and not a generic design.
